This code has data which is an output of the downscaled data which is on my lab's server. The codes represent bits of the larger codes on the server.

My research focuses on discriminating greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing on Tropical Cyclone (TC) frequency. In this study, we downscaled 11 CMIP6 models using a statistical dynamical downscaling model called the Columbia HAZard model. The results from this study shows that both GHG is the main driver of TC activities whiles aerosols dumpens their activities within th Western North Pacific basin. Also, within the North Atlantic basin, both GHG and aerosols shows a decreasing effect with aerosols weakening more as compared to GHG.
